    <h2>About</h2>
    <p align="justify"> I received my M.A. of Science from the <b><a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/"
                                                                     target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Business school of
        Warwick University</a></b> in 2016 and received my B.S. major in Finance(General Honors and Departmental Honors)
        from <b><a href="http://e.swufe.edu.cn/" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;> Southwestern University of Finance and
            Economics</a></b>, China in 2015. After graduating from Warwick, I have worked at a trust and a PE where I
        typically created financial models and conducted research for the firm's clients. </p>

    <p align="justify"> It was during my finance/economics and mathematics coursework in my Master program that I
        realized that I really enjoyed understanding the economics of financial markets and firms and started thinking
        about graduate studies. The thought took deeper root when I worked in the finance field and started observing
        the way information was produced and processed in markets.
    </p>

    <P align="justify">
        Currently, <b>I am inspired to pursue a Ph.D. degree</b> to keep working on the things I am enthusiastic about.
        I am still at an early stage of the academic track and hence my interests are not yet fully determined.
        Recently, I have been mainly into corporate finance and some subfields of economic theory, especially the
        relationship between investor behavior and stock return. When I was studying on the stock market, I spotted that
        firms release announcements in response to their perception of investors’ irrational behavior. More general, the
        information asymmetry and irrationality in the financial market render the conventional economics framework
        untenable. That is where <b>behavioral economics/finance</b> assumes a role. By employing theories in psychology,
        economics attempts to get rid of the classical hypotheses and seems more realistic, challenging my previous
        notion of economics. To this extent, I look forward to further research in behavioral economics/finance and
        decision making.
    </p>

    <h2>Research Experiences</h2>
    <p align="justify"> When I was an intern at Guotai Junan Securities, I participated in a research project regarding
        the high dividend strategies of startups. I collected two-year data on 825 Growth Enterprise Market companies,
        verified the existence of wealth effects in highly sending turn announcements, conducted an in-depth study on
        the likelihood of a company to announce high stock dividends and the transfer of reserve to common shares based
        on its share price, capital stock, undistributed profit and net profit growth rate using the Logit model, and
        simulated an investment portfolio to facilitate investors’ decision-making. The project proved well-done and
        highly recognized by colleagues. Its brief was finally published in Wind, the Chinese version of Bloomberg.</p>

    <h2>Project Experiences</h2>
    <p align="left"><b>Quantitative Methods</b> <br/>
        <i>Instructed by Chengwei Liu, Associate Professor, Strategy and Behavioral Science, Warwick University; Jerker
            Denrell, Professor, Behavioral Science, Warwick University</i>
    </p>
    <p align="justify">We successfully built the appropriate model based on CAPM to investigate the characteristics of
        the overall fluctuation of China’s stock market. We used CSI 300 index as the actual sample to carry out data
        processing with SAS and Eviews, applying multicollinearity and heteroscedasticity tests, and came to the
        conclusion that the overall volatility of China's stock market was superimposed by different fluctuations, which
        further confirmed the existence of different qualities of traders in China's stock market. </p><br/>

    <p align="left"><b>Fundaments of Economics Methods </b> <br/>
        <i>Instructed by Zvi Safra, Professor, Behavioral Science, Warwick University; Tigran Melkonyan, Associate
            Professor, Behavioral Science,Warwick University</i>
    </p>
    <p align="justify">We have learnt classical economic models and theories, and we have tried put practical problems
        into these models. When learning The Market for Lemons proposed by economist George Akerlof, we found out that
        the Lemon Market also exists in China's financial market. Take the securities market as an example, the
        asymmetric information leads to adverse selection, and as a result, market failure occurred. We proposed that
        the best solution to this issue is to achieve Pareto optimality and ensure that all parties get a win-win
        situation. More specifically, it was divided into the optimal design of the primary market and secondary
        market. </p><br/>

    <p align="left"><b>Behavioral Economics</b> <br/>
        <i>Instructed by Andrea Isoni, Professor, Behavioral Science, Warwick University</i>
    </p>
    <p align="justify">We carried out through analysis in the unusual decision-making behavior in lottery transactions
        (the deliberate selection of lottery numbers and the gambler's fallacy), consumer behavior after winning a
        prize in a lottery and the substitutability confusion of money (that is, the same amount of money is not
        completely substitutable), and the Friedman-Savage puzzle based on the theory of cognitive bias and
        behavioral economics such as "psychological account" and overconfidence. </p><br/>

    <p align="left"><b>Portfolio Management</b> <br/>
        <i>Instructed by Söhnke M Bartram, Professor, Finance, Warwick University</i>
    </p>
    <p align="justify">We chose 10 stocks from different industries and calculated the minimum variance and tangency
        portfolio with and without short-sales, we also conducted a principle component analysis on the returns of all
        10 stocks, used parametric and nonparametric methods to compute the VaR and utilized the normal copula to model
        the joint distribution of returns. </p>
